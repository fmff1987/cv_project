# make sure the end-user is authenticated.  If not, redirect to the 'authc.loginUrl' above,
# and after successful authentication, redirect them back to the original account page they
# were trying to view:
/index.xhtml = anon
/login.xhtml = authc
/adm.xhtml = authc
/manager.xhtml = anon
/recruiter = anon
/admCreateRequest.xhtml= authc
/createManager.xhtml= authc
/createRecruiter.xhtml= authc
